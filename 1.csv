They also sell regional food specialties such as iberico ham, chorizo, smoked paprika, turron (nougat),...\r\n\r\nSecurity is fast, which makes check-in desk to gate just a few minutes.\r\n\r\nFree WiFi, provided by Aena.\r\n\r\nParking is free and guarded at night. \r\n\r\nRental car office opens during flight times.\r\n\r\nHowever, access should be improved. When arriving by car, driving from Badajoz (west access), road is OK. However, when driving from Merida (east access), the road is extremely narrow.

Due to various delays from MNL, 4 airplanes landed within 32 minutes of each other and the departure area was packed with about 700+ passengers, some sitting on the floor and blocking access to the queue of the boarding gate. They do not have proper restaurants compared to say, ILO but mostly food stalls with a handful of tables in the pre-departure area. \r\n\r\nThey do have Spa Natura that offers massages (for a fee) which is a good way to spend those extra hours which are caused by delays coming in from MNL.

The main advantage is that it is very close to Downtown Belo Horizonte (instead of Confins Int' Airport), it`s pretty easy to get there by taxi or by public transportation. It has just one restaurant, a cafeteria in the boarding area, a souvenir shop and some ATM in the hall. As many old airports there is still an observation terrance open for public with no fences, a very pleasent place to observate the planes. Check'in very fast and easy security check, the boarding area has two floors, going up there is a nice panoramic window. Very pratic airport if you don't need to remain much time there."

The plan was to have a 1.5-hour layover in my travel from LHR to a city in Schengen area. The airport does not seem to be designed for connecting flights. The path to my departure gate was through arrivals\/baggage claim and then I had to join a horrendous queue to security check (the same queue also for those who start their journey at CGN). I tried to find out if I there was a fast track, but it turned out that you had to book it online 12 hours in advance… People who managed the flow of the line to security were either extremely rude or pretended not to speak a word in English.

Have your proof of vaccination ready to show upon arrival.\r\n- The Honduran government says that travelers must register online with immigration in advance, but the online system doesn't work so don't waste your time.

The moment you step foot inside, it becomes clear that you've made a grave mistake.\r\n\r\nThe passenger terminal is nothing short of appalling. Imagine the smallest, most ill-equipped bus station you've ever had the displeasure of visiting, multiply that discomfort by ten, and you might begin to approach the woeful conditions of this place. There is no suitable structure to accommodate the rush of travelers, and the amenities are just as sparse. \r\n\r\nMy ill-fated choice to fly with Turkish Airlines and Ethiopian merely amplified my troubles. In a twist of fate that, in hindsight, seems entirely predictable, my luggage did not arrive with my flight. Given the obvious shortcomings of the airport, I wasn't surprised, just disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe situation devolved further as I attempted to retrieve my lost baggage. The baggage claim staff, if one can indeed refer to them as such, were lackadaisical at best and negligent at worst. Slow to react, devoid of any motivation, and exuding an aura of casual indifference, they made the agonizing ordeal of a lost luggage even more tormenting. Their evident lack of commitment and professionalism did not instill any confidence in their ability to perform their duties effectively. \r\n\r\nAdding insult to injury, if your luggage happens to arrive in a damaged state - a scenario that, given my experience, seems more likely than not - their response is simply that they can do nothing. As if losing one's luggage wasn't stressful enough, to hear that any damages incurred will not be accounted for is a disheartening blow. \r\n\r\nIt's a trial of patience to assert your rights and make any headway in this chaotic environment. One needs to be prepared to go through the rigmarole of collecting every possible shred of documentation and evidence, and then engage the airline in your home country's court.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Entebbe Airport is a veritable nightmare of inefficiency, apathy, and disorganization. It's a stark contrast to the tranquility and beauty of Uganda itself. Travellers beware: if you value your peace of mind and your possessions, avoid this airport at all costs."

It's sweet, but also pretty ridiculous.  There's no way to get back upstairs for departures, except to go through the parkade...where neither elevator was in service.  Back up there to check in, only to go BACK through exit immigration and filling out the same paper form for the second time in 2 hours.  Hot as hell in there for the most part too.\r\n\r\nThere's wifi in the terminal and it's not terrible, I'll give them that, but the rest of the terminal is pretty dreadful.

Rest weren't open yet. Also like any Starbucks in an airport, it was painfully packed for those who needed caffeine to survive the day. \r\n\r\nThe shops are fine. There is a whiskey store, but if you fly out Sunday, they can't start selling until 1pm due to blue laws nonsense that should be off the books. I digress, I wasn't planning on getting anything, but they had some good whiskies as a last minute gift idea. Otherwise your stores are basically the news store with snacks and a magazine. I didn't see a full book store at all, or an electronic store. But the news stores to vending machines sold a good selection of headphones. \r\n\r\nFinally, the seating is outdated. They don't have outlets at all outside of a random wall spot that I was lucky to find at an empty gate that morning, but no luck at a full gate. Wifi worked on my phone, but not on my PC. It refused to be authorized. \r\n\r\nOverall it's an okay airport. It's clean, lighting is good, and the facilities work. The only huge issue is the wifi for me at least. But the biggest issue is the lack of outlets in 2022. That is a necessity nowadays for work to entertainment. \r\n\r\np.s.: TSA precheck was a little slow for some reason.

In Antigua, you are given a Montserrat immigration form, which includes a departure stub.  You must keep that stub for when you leave.  Antigua immigration forms are distributed in the airport.  The immigration desk is one agent, which is fine considering flights have no more than 7 passengers.\r\n\r\nSecurity is one line, and you have to sit in the open-air check-in area until about 15-20 minutes before your flight in which you go through security (standard TSA take-off-your-shoes) and enter the air-conditioned departure lounge.\r\n\r\nThe employees were nice."

Check in goes pretty fast, as there's just one desk for at most one flight per day. Security screening starts just minutes before boarding and doesn't seem to be too strict. The airport has one cafe that serves food (no menu, no English spoken. Just point and smile and hope it's decent). It also has a tiny shop for some soft drink and even a tiny (instant) coffee shop.

After buying a ticket in advance passengers have no idea what to do next. Asking if a particular bus is the one that I should get on always had a negative answer. Then some random guy would come alone and point to the bus I was to get on. They do drop passengers right at their accommodation, or as close to it as possible, which is good.

The staff on the airport are very friendly and helpful. Due to the airports small size and low level of commercial activity it provides a hassle-free experience. However, for the same reasons the service amenities are few besides one restaurant serving typical roadside restaurant food (not meant as a negative characteristic) and some snacks and soft drinks. The quality of the food is above average, but nothing out of the ordinary. Furthermore, public transportation options are poor, with only one bus alternative with departures every 2 hrs or so, and it requires a 300m walk from the terminal to the bus stop. Beyond that, taxi is the only other option, or renting a car from Europcar which provides cars for rental at the airport. Parking at the airport is free. \r\n\r\nAll in all, Skien Geiteryggen airport is a very nice and calm airport to travel to and from and provides a pleasant travel experience, in spite of the few drawbacks regarding accessibility by public transportation."

I haven't tried the wifi, but given that all other passengers were connected I guess it's good. Staff is very friendly. The only downside is getting to and from the airport. It can only be reached by taxi, if you don't want to walk for 90 minutes. Prepare to bring a big bag with money, you'll need it... Anyway, apart from that, the airport has a philosophy of not making simple things complex and to offer memorable service to their passengers. I think they succeed."

First of all, you have to pay 1€ to enter the airport by car... Luckily, you can still enter for free if you come by foot, but you never know when even this might end (Italians moves towards the tourists are becoming less and less favourable...). The airport is closed between 00:30 and 00:43, so you're kinda stuck for the whole night in Trapani, Marsala or anywhere else nearby (or you can sleep outside for 4 hours, sometimes in cold, cuz there's literally nothing to do around). The security check speeks surprisingly bad English. The guy took my phone with a QR-code and didn't give me back until I reminded him of it... Also, there was a mess with the gates and communications, although this was a Ryanair's fault as well. The airport is small with not so many interesting shops\/cafés, I also haven't seen the sockets until the final gate departure hall. Not really recommending this airport if not necessary."

It's along the main road in Virac and there's lots of tricycles waiting. \r\n\r\nNow for the bad part: it's chaos overall. It starts with check in. There's no system, no check in facilities and the terminal building is a size or three too small to handle a single short haul jet aircraft like the A320. Add that most people in Virac are not used to flying and it easily takes over an hour to get checked in while the queue seems to be manageable and would take 5 to 10 minutes for a professional crew to process. And apparently people are just allowed to leave and enter the line at their own convenience, so the number of people waiting for you differs every minute. \r\n\r\nNow for security. It's lacking. There is no security here. They do a small scan when entering the terminal, and there's an x-ray machine for hand luggage and scanner for people, but they're not in use. Security staff just takes 5 seconds to go through your hand luggage, approve it, send you through the scanner and when it beeps, no one reacts. Hold luggage is delivered at check in and not scanned either. You can basically deliver anything here. \r\n\r\nThere is no wifi, unless you have a Philippine phone. \r\n\r\nThere is no business lounge. The general waiting area is about 3 sizes too small to contain all the people waiting for a small aircraft like the A320. There's simply not enough room. \r\n\r\nApart from a toilet, there are no facilities here. Expect no shop or vending machine. There is none. There's a sign stating that there is a shop on the top floor, but its apparently indefinitely closed. \r\n\r\nThere is a huge load of staff though. About 10 security guards, about 20 people working for the airline or airport are on site, but only 3 people really seem to be doing something productive. The rest just hangs around and comments a bit on passengers or things. \r\n\r\nAll in all, it's the Fawlty Towers of the airports."

The departures hall is spacious and, when I passed through, almost empty. I didn't spend too much time there as I had checked-in online. From boarding pass check to clearing security took 10mins. I felt that this was good since there was a large queue. All of the channels were open and there were several loading stations per belt, so the queue moved quickly. The queue for immigration was equally speedy. The immigration officer was friendly. Airside was quiet too. There is a small number of facilities airside, all of which had free space. I didn't notice anywhere serving proper meals. Nor did I notice any water bottle filling stations. My flight was departing from gate 17, reached by an escalator at the left hand end of the concourse. This is a small area with a simple facilities. There is probably sufficient seating for the number of passengers that a CRJ900 can carry."

Queue at the check in, queue at the security control, where everything was chaotic. Poor organisation from the staff in this airport. Be sure to arrive in time for all the procedures cause otherwise you’ll miss your flight. The bathrooms were also dirty and the floor was slippery. Not to mention that the check in area stinks. Stinks so bad that you can feel it even through the mask!\r\n"

Barely anywhere to eat airside, your options being an 'Italian'-style restaurant stuck in the 70s, a Burger King or a self-service kind of arrangement reminiscent of a tacky ski resort.
